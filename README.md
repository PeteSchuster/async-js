# Asynchronous JavaScript: From Callbacks to Async/Await

Course materials for 11/2/18 workshop at LibertyJS

## Setup

1) Install Node and Git if you haven't already.
2) Clone this repo to your machine.
3) In the project root directory run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
4) Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Browser support

Make sure you're using a modern browser that supports [Promises](https://caniuse.com/#feat=promises) and [async functions](https://caniuse.com/#feat=async-functions). Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari are a safe bet â€” pretty much any browser but Internet Explorer.

## json-server

The only third party library we're using is [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), a fake REST API. We're just using this so we don't have to rely on the conference wifi when we're playing with XHR.

## Dogs

And there's a bunch of pics of dogs because [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).
